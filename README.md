# INT247-MUSHROOM-CLASSIFICATION

This project aims at developing a machine-learning algorithm that will determine if a certain mushroom is edible or poisonous by its specifications like cap shape, cap color, gill color, etc. using different classifiers.



To do so, I have used the following classification methods:



1- Decision Tree Classifier 
2- Logistic Regression Classifier
3- k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
4- Support Vector Machine Classifier
5- Naive Bayes Classifier
6-Random Forest Classifier
